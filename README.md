# Hydraulic-and-Hydrologic-Modelling-Tool
HHMT is an integrated package of hydraulic and hydrologic analysis tools, in which the user interacts with the system through the use of a graphical user interface (GUI). The system is capable of performing steady and unsteady flow water surface profile calculation and several hydraulic computations

The objective of this software tool is to develop a modelling system that can solve several hydrological problems
and set up certain kind of conceptual and physical-based models.
The modelling system consists of three part, Backwater Curve Calculator, HBV Modeller and Free Surface Flow Simulator. Each of the system allows you to input parameters and obtain the results of the model in the form of plots as well as tables. It also allows you to save the results in files.
